For this assignment, our primary task was to develop a comprehensive knowledge base encompassing various courses offered by the Computer Science Department at Brown, along with their associated prerequisites. This knowledge base is asked to be formulated using Prolog, a logical programming language that is often used for tasks that involve knowledge representation and inference.
The use of predicates and rules in SWI-Prolog allowed me to create facts and rules for relationships between objects. I chose to model the prerequisite relationships differently based on different prerequisites, which creates more flexibility in defining the course prerequisite. In addition, I used ‘list’ for the storage of variables instead of hard coding it one by one, which lessens the lines of codes. Ultimately to test my system, I created queries to simulate possible scenarios in which the questions could be possibly asked, and further proved the correctness of my code.
Our system worked effectively in correctly assigning the different computer science courses to their respective categories. We assigned appropriate rules to different types of courses. Finally, we were also able to answer all the questions provided in section 3 using our facts and rules. 
Our methods and choices were appropriate for successfully completing section three of the prolog project. We were able to assign the different courses to the different functions that were true for a specific course.
